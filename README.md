## Features

- Real-time physics simulation
- Interactive cutting mechanism
- Natural fabric movement
- Gravity and wave effects
- Responsive design
- Smooth animations


## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vite
- TailwindCSS

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tulle-cutting-simulation.git


2. Navigate to the project directory
- cd tulle-cutting-simulation


3. Install dependencies
- npm install
 - or
- yarn install


4. Start the development server
- npm run dev
 - or
- yarn dev


5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/

## Usage

- Click and drag your mouse across the fabric to cut it
- The fabric will react to your movements with realistic physics
- Cut pieces will fall naturally due to gravity
